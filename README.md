# scDiff comparisons

This repository contains scripts to compare `scDiff` (developed by Simone Tiberi) with `diffcyt` methods (Weber et al. 2019), using CyTOF datasets previously used for the `diffcyt` evaluations (Weber et al. 2019) and distributed via the [`HDCytoData` package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData) (Weber and Soneson, 2019).


## Contents

- [example](example/): directory containing small example script showing how to run `scDiff`
- [scripts](scripts/): scripts to run `diffcyt` methods on `Weber_BCR_XL_sim` benchmark datasets from the `HDCytoData` package

    - main simulations
    - null simulations
    - 'less distinct' simulations
